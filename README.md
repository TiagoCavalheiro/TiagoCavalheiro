## 🎯 About Me

Hi, I'm Tiago. I'm a 17-year-old software developer from Portugal, currently studying in a professional programming course. I'm focused on learning and improving my skills every day, and I plan to continue my education at university in the field of Computer Science if I can save the money to make it happen.

Right now, I'm working at VOST Portugal where I help develop technology to support emergency response and civil protection.

Outside of school and work, I also like creating custom modpacks for Minecraft. It's something I really enjoy and it helps me think about how different systems fit and work together.
